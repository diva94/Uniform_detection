### Uniform_detection
Assessment for 3frames, deep learning code for detecting uniform of various army personnel.
### data_augment.py:
This script is used to augment the data, we have used augmentation technique because of low availability of data.
### uniform_detection.ipynb:
This is Google colab sheet, this includes creating the dataset, training the layers and validating the model.
As there was low availability of data, we created our own CNN Layers as a Deep Learning model to do the classification task.
